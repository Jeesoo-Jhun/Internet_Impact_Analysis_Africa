## Overview

This project investigates the multifaceted impact of internet usage on economic, political, and environmental development in East and South Africa. It combines thorough data analysis and machine learning modeling to explore key socio-economic questions.

## 1. Analysis Summary

### Key Objectives
- To analyze the relationship between internet penetration and GDP growth.
- To assess how internet usage affects governance quality, environmental sustainability, and other development metrics.
- To identify variables that moderate the effect of internet usage on socio-economic outcomes.

### Core Questions Explored
- **How does internet usage correlate with GDP growth?**
- **Does increased internet access impact governance quality, such as the rule of law and government effectiveness?**
- **What role does internet usage play in CO2 emissions, and how does it relate to environmental sustainability?**
- **How does access to electricity influence the effect of internet penetration on economic growth?**
- **What differentiates countries with substantial improvements from those with minimal gains in internet usage?**

## 2. Data Insights and Initial Findings

### Data Processing
The datasets used include global development indicators, focusing on variables such as internet usage, GDP, governance metrics, CO2 emissions, and access to electricity.

### Key Insights
- **GDP and Internet Usage**: There is a notable positive relationship between internet usage and GDP growth in certain regions.
- **Governance Impact**: The relationship between internet penetration and governance indicators shows variability.
- **Environmental Analysis**: Analysis of CO2 emissions highlights whether internet usage contributes to sustainability or increased emissions.
- **Infrastructure Moderation**: The analysis suggests that access to electricity moderates the economic impact of internet usage.

## 3. Machine Learning Modeling

### Key Predictive Questions
1. **Predicting GDP**: Can internet usage and other socio-economic indicators predict GDP accurately?
2. **Classifying Political Stability**: Can countries be categorized based on political stability using governance and internet data?
3. **Predicting CO2 Emissions**: What features predict CO2 emission levels, and how significant is internet usage?
4. **Governance Effectiveness Prediction**: Can governance quality be modeled using economic and technological indicators?
5. **Classifying Economic Development Levels**: Is it possible to classify countries by economic development (high, medium, low GDP) using these indicators?

### Modeling Approaches
- **Regression Models**: Applied Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression.
- **Classification Algorithms**: Used Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Feature Importance**: Ensemble models provided insights into the most influential predictors.

## 4. Key Results

### Predictive Outcomes
- **GDP Prediction**: Machine learning models highlighted internet usage and access to electricity as significant features for predicting GDP.
- **Governance Analysis**: Certain governance metrics could be moderately predicted, suggesting a nuanced relationship with digital connectivity.
- **CO2 Emissions**: Internet usage ranked variably among predictors, with other socio-economic and environmental factors playing more dominant roles.

### Challenges and Considerations
- **Multicollinearity**: Acknowledged dependencies between features like GDP and ROI.
- **Feature Engineering**: Importance of refining datasets for better model performance.

## 5. Recommendations and Future Work

- **Economic Policy Guidance**: Leverage insights on how digital infrastructure impacts GDP and governance to guide policy.
- **Sustainability Measures**: Analyze data further to differentiate internet's role in sustainability.
- **Infrastructure Investments**: Prioritize access to electricity as a complement to digital expansion.

## 6. Visualization and Presentation

The visualizations were created using tools like Tableau and Matplotlib for clear and interactive stakeholder presentations.
